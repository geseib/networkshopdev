# Setup the Datacenter and VPCs

![Specify Details Screenshot](../images/hybrid-subnets-diagram.png)

Using a predefined CloudFormation template, we will deploy a Simulated Datacenter in a VPC, as well as several VPC for our Non-production, Production, and Shared Services environments. We will add the connectivity in the next module.
