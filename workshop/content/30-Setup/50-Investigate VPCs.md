# Investigate the VPCs

## Look at the Subnets, route tables, etc.

1. In the AWS Management Console change to the region you plan to work in and change. This is in the upper right hand drop down menu.

1. In the AWS Management Console choose **Services** then select **VPC**.

1. From the left-hand menu select **Your VPCs**.

1. Notice we have Created the following VPCs

   - P1-_your_stack_name_
   - NP1-_your_stack_name_
   - NP2-_your_stack_name_
   - DCS1-_your_stack_name_
   - DS1-_your_stack_name_

1. Feel free to look around other aspects of the VPC, such as the **subnets** and the **route tables**. You will notice for example both NP1-_your_stack_name_-Priv-A Subnet and NP1-_your_stack_name_-Priv-B Subnet share a same **Route table**, NP1-_your_stack_name_-Private Route Table. And that Route table only has a route for the local VPC CIDR block. We will be changing that in the next lab, so that you can route outside of the NP1 VPC.

## Connect to the shell of a Linux EC2 instance

1. In the AWS Management Console choose **Services** then select **Systems Manager**. Systems Manager Gain Operational Insight and Take Action on AWS Resources. We are going to take a look a just one of seven capabilities of Systems Manager.

1. From the menu on the left, Scroll down and select **Session Manager**. Session Manager allows us to use IAM role and policies to determine who has console access without having to manage ssh keys for our instances.

1. In the main pane, click the **Start session** button. Pick an Instance to shell into. You will now enter a bash shell prompt for that instance.

1. Run a few commands like **ifconfig** or **cat /etc/resolv.conf**

   ```
   sh-4.2$ ifconfig
   eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 9001
           inet 10.16.21.58  netmask 255.255.248.0  broadcast 10.16.23.255
           inet6 fe80::13:45ff:fe79:926c  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
           ether 02:13:45:79:92:6c  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)

           TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

   lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
           inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
           inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
           loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
           RX packets 8  bytes 648 (648.0 B)
           RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
           TX packets 8  bytes 648 (648.0 B)
           TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

   sh-4.2$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
   ; generated by /usr/sbin/dhclient-script
   search us-west-2.compute.internal
   options timeout:2 attempts:5
   nameserver 10.16.0.2
   ```

# Congratulations

You now have **completed** this section. Continue to the next section to setup communication between VPCs and the Datacenter.
