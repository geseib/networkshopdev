# Create A new VPC for Non-Production

Run CloudFormation template 4.tgw-vpcs.yaml to deploy the VPC in the Same Region as the other accounts Transit Gateway was built in.

## HOW TO Deploy the VPC

1. In the AWS Management Console change to the region the VPCs and Transit Gateway were created **IN THE OTHER ACCOUNT**. This is in the upper right-hand drop-down menu. _note: Today, AWS Transit Gateway can only attach to VPCs in the same region as the Transit Gateway. There are architectures that allow for a multi-region design, for example using VPN and a Transit VPC. This is out of scope for this lab._

1. Click on the CloudFormation Launch link below that corresponds to the AWS Region in which your partner deployed their Transit Gateway.

1. For the **Specify stack details** give the stack a name and Select two Availability Zones (AZs) to deploy to. _We will be deploying all of the VPCs in the same AZs, but that is not required by AWS Transit Gateway_. Click **Next**.

1. For **Configuration stack options** we don't need to change anything, so just click **Next** in the bottom right.

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the **Review name_of_your_stack** and check the **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.** Click the **Create** button in the lower right.
