The Juniper vSRX is a High Performance Next Generation Firewall solution, including core firewall, VPN, NAT, advanced L4-L7 security services such as Application Security, IPS and UTM capabilities.

*note: The vSRX software image includes a 60-day trial license. When you download and install the vSRX image, you are entitled to use this trial license for 60 days. It is intended as an evaluation license for using vSRX. This product-unlocking license is required to use the basic functions of the vSRX, such as networking, routing, and basic security features (such as stateful firewall).*
