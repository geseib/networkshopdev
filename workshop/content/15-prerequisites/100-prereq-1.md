1. Admin access to the AWS account

1. Access to one of the following regions in that AWS Account:

- N. Virginia (us-east-1)
- Ohio (us-east-2)
- Oregon (us-west-2)
- Ireland (eu-west-1)
- Singapore (ap-southeast-1)

1. **You will need to remove all exisiting VPCs in the region you are working with**, so ideally this is a new account or one where you do not have anything deployed in one of the above regions. _if this is a new account or account provided by the workshop, you are in good shape._
